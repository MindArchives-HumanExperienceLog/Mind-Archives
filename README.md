# Mind-Archives
A day to day update of my human experience. Tracking my consciousness and mind over varying periods of time. This archive, serves as a response to time's attack on the transient nature of human life. I hope when I look back, 50 years down the line, I can see how I lived my human experience, how I spent the only true currency  of existence -my time.
